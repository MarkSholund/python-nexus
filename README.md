# FastAPI Nexus Proxy

A simple **FastAPI-based proxy server** for caching and serving Maven and PyPI artifacts locally. This service acts as a local cache for upstream repositories, reducing external requests and improving artifact availability.

---

## Features

- **Maven Proxy**
  - Serves artifacts from a local cache.
  - Fetches missing artifacts from [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2).
  - Returns appropriate HTTP status codes for missing or failed artifacts.

- **PyPI Proxy**
  - Serves package index (`simple/`) and JSON metadata (`/json`) from a local cache.
  - Caches actual package files under `packages/`.
  - Fetches missing packages from [PyPI](https://pypi.org).
  - Supports conditional GET with ETag and Last-Modified headers.

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Ensure `requirements.txt` includes at least:
>
> ```text
> fastapi
> uvicorn
> httpx
> beautifulsoup4
> ```

---

## Configuration

- **Upstream URLs**

```python
MAVEN_UPSTREAM = "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2"
PYPI_UPSTREAM = "https://pypi.org"
```

- **Local cache directories**

```python
from pathlib import Path
CACHE_DIR = Path("/webroot/search/storage/cache")  # or use environment variable
MAVEN_CACHE = CACHE_DIR / "maven"
PYPI_CACHE = CACHE_DIR / "pypi"
```

Ensure these directories exist and are writable by the application.

---

## Usage

Run the FastAPI server using **Uvicorn**:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Endpoints

- **Maven proxy**

```
GET /maven2/{groupId}/{artifactId}/{version}/{artifact}.jar
```

- **PyPI proxy**

```
GET /pypi/simple/                   # Root HTML index
GET /pypi/simple/{package}/          # Package index HTML
GET /pypi/{package}/json             # Package JSON metadata
GET /pypi/{package}/{version}/json   # Version-specific JSON
GET /pypi/packages/{path}            # Package files (wheel, tar, zip, etc.)
```

---

## Caching Behavior

- Files are served from the local cache if they exist.
- If a file is missing, it is downloaded, cached, and served.
- Supports **ETag** and **Last-Modified** headers for conditional GET requests.
- Upstream errors return proper HTTP status codes:
  - `404` for not found
  - `502` or upstream status code for other errors

---

## Logging

- The app uses standard Python `logging`.
- You can configure the logging format using:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format="%(levelprefix)s %(asctime)s | %(message)s",
)
```

- The logs will show cache hits, upstream fetches, and errors.

---

## Environment Variables

- You can override cache directory with:

```bash
export CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache
```

- Default is `/webroot/search/storage/cache`.

## Notes

- Recommended for internal artifact caching and proxying.
- Ensure cache directories have sufficient disk space for artifacts.
- Timeout for upstream requests:
  - Maven: 60 seconds
  - PyPI package files: 120 seconds
- Supports conditional GETs to reduce unnecessary bandwidth.
